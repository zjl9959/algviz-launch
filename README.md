# Algviz launch ðŸš€

This repo collects the algorithm animations and source codes based on the project [algviz](https://github.com/zjl9959/algviz).

*Algviz is an algorithm animatin engine implement in Python. You can learn more from [algviz.com](https://algviz.com/).*

For example, this [notebook](notebooks/classic/BubbleSort.ipynb) show the animation of bubbleSort algorithm:
